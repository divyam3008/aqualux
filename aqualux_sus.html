    1. Ditch the Bottle <br>
    According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, it’s estimated that by 2050 there will be one piece of plastic for
    every fish in the ocean. That’s alarming to think about! Most big brand soaps come in a plastic bottle, which
    depending on the type of plastic, may or may not be recyclable. <br>


    By using an eco-friendly soap, which is typically produced in bar form, you will be preventing 1 bottle of plastic
    from being produced and then disposed of. It may not seem like a lot, but over several generations in a household,
    this can be a significant step towards reducing your plastic waste and helping resolve the global problem of plastic
    pollution. <br>


    2. Protect Our Waterways and Marine Life <br>
    When soap is washed down the drain it can end up in our lakes, rivers, and oceans. These synthetic-based chemicals
    can wreak havoc. A detergent or surfactant breaks the surface tension of water which can make it for small creatures
    that get around on the surface of the water. When the surface tension is lower, it will reduce the oxygen levels of
    the water, causing harm to fish and other marine dwelling wildlife. Phosphates in soaps or detergents can cause
    freshwater algal blooms that release toxins and ultimately depletes oxygen for aquatic life. <br>


    Think about the cumulative effect this can have on a body of water over several years, decades, or even generations.
    An eco-friendly soap should be chemical-free and made from only natural plant or oil-based ingredients which are
    biodegradable and will not disrupt the natural eco-system of the environment. <br>

    3. Save Your Skin <br>
    If you use a chemical-based soap, chances are it contains some synthetic chemicals that could be harmful to your
    skin. Triclosan is an anti-bacterial chemical often found in soaps and toothpaste can cause skin irritation.
    Formaldehyde, a preservative found in many soaps and cosmetics is usually found in small concentrations, however, it
    can cause allergic reactions and skin rashes in some. Not what you had in mind when you lather up your soap right? <br>


    An eco-friendly soap is suitable not just for those with sensitive skin but for anyone who wants to protect it. A
    naturally produced bar of eco-friendly soap will leave the skin more hydrated without any risk of exposure to
    potentially harsh toxic chemicals. <br>

    4. Prevent Animal Cruelty <br>
    Unless your current soap says “vegan” or “cruelty-free” on the label, you can’t be sure that animals are not harmed
    during the production or testing processes. However, many big companies don’t
    want you to know their dirty secrets about testing their products on animals. This saddens us to think of an animal
    suffering just so a product can be developed and sold for profit. <br>


    The good news is that AquaLux is an eco-friendly that stands up and does the humane thing and produces
    personal care products without harming animals. Look for “vegan” AND “cruelty-free” on the label to be sure no
    animals were harmed during the ingredient sourcing, production process, and testing. <br>

    5. Give Back <br>
    A reputable eco-friendly brand will be committed to lowering its environmental impact and produce their products
    will sustainability in mind. Some eco-friendly brands even go a step further by planting trees.

    By doing some quick background research on an eco-friendly brand such as AQUALUX before you buy, you can be more informed as a
    consume. You are also supporting a business that has the best
    interest of the environment in mind. <br>

    6. Save Money <br>
    Stop spending your hard-earned money on designer or luxury brands of personal care products that are chock full of
    chemicals. I've seen some personal care and beauty products that can even cost up to $100 per product!

    A quality eco-friendly soap bar will cost you no more than 30 AED . It will also last much longer than a liquid soap or
    body wash. Our Soap is way more efficient for its price <br>

    7. Sustainable <br>
    Many big brand soaps contain palm oil. Palm oil production has been under scrutiny as its responsible for a
    significant percentage of the world's deforestation. This is because forests are burned illegally in order to grow
    oil palms due to their value. Unfortunately, with destroyed forests comes destroyed wildlife that inhabits them.
    These include endangered species like orangutans, rhinos, elephants, and tigers. These forest burns also cause air
    pollution and release high levels of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br>

    Fortunately We are sustainable ,  We try our best to avoid it altogether and use an eco-friendly soap that is palm oil-free. Instead, we are
    making our soaps from ingredients such as plant-based or essential oils which are sustainably produced through organic farming
    and responsible ingredient sourcing practices.
